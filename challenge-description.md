# Stream Reasoning Workshop 2019 - Challenge Track

# Description

The idea of the Stream Reasoning (SR) Challenge originated in a first
session held at the SR Workshop 2018, where several groups worked out a possible
formats for comparing and evaluating stream reasoning/processing 
tools. 

One conclusion, worded by Boris and Jacobo, was that our community misses an unified agreement
on the used formalism, languages, and standards that captures stream
reasoning/processing.
It is too early to conduct a benchmark competition that
compares the performance of existing tool, hence a "model and solve"
competition would be more suitable.
<!-- is not feasible yet. -->

A "model and solve" challenge aims at evaluating the modelling skills
independent of the formalism/language.  For this, we provide the two
given scenario, cooperative intelligence transport systems (C-ITS) and
social media streams with one or more tasks to solve.  At the end of
the challenge, we aim at evaluating the development effort, easyness of
use, and originality of the solutions.

Importantly, the initial plan was to conduct a full challenge at the Stream Reasoning
Workshop 2019. However, due to several open points and time limitation,
we plan to finalize a clear format for challenge, and conduct the
actual challenge on a future date (tbd).


<!--
The different teams can bring their own tools or are encouraged
to apply another preferred tools, which might be from
a different community.

**Important: Please let us know what tool you will provide or would
  like to use, so we can prepare ourselves for it!**

of introducing more  use cases and data sources. The second
program point will be a progress report on the hackaton,
which includes the outline of two scenarios and possible tasks that

# Problem Description, Scenario, Tasks

As mentioned, the format will be a "model and solve" challenge, where the
modelling skills independent of the formalism/language are
evaluated. We outline the two combined scenarios, introduce the tasks,
and outline the rules.

## Scenarios

**C-ITS.**
This C-ITS scenario is in the area of  cooperative intelligent
transportation systems (C-ITS), where we are able observe and
analyze streams of vehicle movements and traffic light signal phases.
Additionally, we will include unexpected events (triggering by us)
such as vehicle breakdowns.

In this scenario we can group the tasks to be tackled into:

* Gathering traffic statistics, e.g., counting the number of vehicles passing;
* Event detection, e.g. detecting, accidents or traffic jams;
* Diagnosis, e.g., finding the cause for a  traffic jam;
* Motion planning, e.g., routing the vehicles optimally through the network.

The challenges of this scenarios originates from spatio-temporal
nature of the traffic data, the possible hight velocity and volume,
and as well the rather complex domain model.

**Social Network Stream.**
The Social Network Stream provides social stream data generated by users connected to a social network. 
The stream data is provided by a data generator of [LSBench](https://code.google.com/archive/p/lsbench/) 
that is built on top of [Social Network Benchmark](http://ldbcouncil.org/developer/snb)
of [Linked Data Benchmark Council](http://ldbcouncil.org/). The data generator emulates the data distribution
on social network connections among users, their posted contents and their location data. Following the diagram
of the data schema in LSBench.

**Combined Scenario.**
Both scenario are integrated into a transport social media scenarios,
where the data of two above scenarios are correllated and can be overlayed.
In particular, users in social network can be pedestrians or owners of the vehicles
or users taking a ride-sharing services. Besides, the events relevant to traffic (e.g.
music events, acidents, etc) can be extracted from messages/posts in a social media
platformt, e.g. twitter.
 The combination allows us to add contextual
information to the vehicle movements and variable locations
to the messages. One task could include to distinguish different
causes for a traffic jam, i.e., the traffic jam could be caused
by external causes, e.g. a concert, or internal causes related
to an overload of the road network. 


## Tasks

Following, we present three fixed tasks, which are extended with
user submitted task.

**Task 1 (C-ITS).**
Traffic jam detection...


**Task 2 (Social Media).**
To be defined...


**Task 3 (Combined).**
External causes, e.g. a concert, versus internal causes related
to an overload of the road network...

# Rules and Evaluation

<!-- ## Rules and Evaluation -->

We introduce the following rules (open for discussion):

(1) The organizers select a number of problem tasks, which aree
     selected from the given (see above) and user-submitted tasks. A
     set of test streams for each task is predefined, expressed in
     possible instance input formats Datalog and RDF.

(2) The organizers provide a set of tools (list below), however, users are allow to
   bring their own tools, or even simply use scripts.

(3) For each task, teams are allowed to use a specific solver (or a
solving script) and a problem encoding.

(4) Teams can either be assembled before the conference, or are on-demand
    set-up at the begin of the challenge.

(5) Solutions should be presented at the end of the competition. 

After the solution presentation, a jury selected from the workshop
participant give scores according on the  criteria:

* Development effort,
* Operability and easyness of use,
* Problem coverage,
* Originality of the solutions.

# Data, Platform, Systems


## ITS Data

The provided data is based on a realistic traffic simulation of four
intersections in a #-shaped layout. The scenario environment was
developed with the microscopic traffic simulation *SUMO* or *PTV VISSIM* 
that allows us to simulate realistic driving behavior and signal
phases. The structure of the intersection, driving patterns and signal
phases are fixed, but we have adapted the traffic densities by light,
medium, and heavy traffic.

We extracted the actual state of each simulation step, allowing us to
replay the simulation from the logs.Throughput of the replayed streams
can be increased by replaying the simulation with 5ms, 10ms,
50ms, and 100ms (real-time speed of traffic) delay.

**Static Knowledge:**
As shown in the figure, each intersection connects four roads with two incoming and outgoing lanes for each road.
For the two incoming lane one signal group is assigned.
Further, for each lane we define is geometrical extension (a polygon) and
the connection from in incoming to outgoing lanes. As an example, lane "i100\_l1" in our model is
described in Datalog as:

* ``` intersection(i100). ```
* ``` mapLaneIn(i100_l1). ```
* ``` isPartOf(i100_l8, i100). ```
* ``` hasGeo(i100_l1, "POLY((0 1, 2 1, 2 3, 0 3, 0 1))"). ```
* ``` connected(i100_l1, i100_l3). ```

![#-shaped intersections](DynaCon_Grid.pdf)


The four signal groups are managed by one traffic light controller,
which assigns red (stop) and green (go) states to signal phases. The
signal phases for each signal group are encoded in a signal plan,
where the green/red split of a full phase length is defined.

We provide two separate schemas for this, one is the ITS ontology
(http://www.kr.tuwien.ac.at/research/projects/loctrafflog/ekaw2018/)
and the other is simplified version of the ontology encoded in
Datalog. 

**Data Streams:**
The microscopic model of the traffic is represented by four data
streams extracted from simulation in each step.  They include vehicle
speed and position, heading, as well as signal phase states.  each
data point has an vehicle ID $id$ (beside signal group id $group$, and
a time stamp $ts$ assigned:

* ``` speed(id, speed, ts) ```
* ``` pos(id, point(x,y), ts) ```
* ``` heading(id, angle, ts) ```
* ``` signalPhase(group, state, ts) ```

**PS: We could add a weather stream...**
